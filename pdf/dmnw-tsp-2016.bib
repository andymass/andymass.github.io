        Suppose that we wish to estimate a vector $\x \in \C^n$ from a small 
        number of noisy linear measurements of the form $\y = \A \x + \z$, 
        where $\z$ represents measurement noise.  When the vector $\x$ is
        sparse, meaning that it has only $s$ nonzeros with $s \ll n$, one can
        obtain a significantly more accurate estimate of $\x$ by adaptively
        selecting the rows of $\A$ based on the previous measurements provided
        that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is sufficiently large. In this
        paper we consider the case where we wish to realize the potential of
        adaptivity but where the rows of $\A$ are subject to physical
        constraints.  In particular, we examine the case where the rows of
        $\A$ are constrained to belong to a finite set of allowable
        measurement vectors. We demonstrate both the limitations and
        advantages of adaptive sensing in this constrained setting. We prove
        that for certain measurement ensembles, the benefits offered by
        adaptive designs fall far short of the improvements that are possible
        in the unconstrained adaptive setting.  On the other hand, we also
        provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that in some scenarios
        adaptivity does still result in substantial improvements even in the
        constrained setting. To illustrate these potential gains, we propose
        practical algorithms for constrained adaptive sensing by exploiting
        connections to the theory of optimal experimental design and show that
        these algorithms exhibit promising performance in some representative
        applications.
