    abstract  = {
        Suppose that we wish to estimate a vector $\x$ from a set of binary 
        paired comparisons of the form ``$\x$ is closer to 
        $\p$ than to $\q$'' for various choices of vectors $\p$ and $\q$.
        The problem of estimating $\x$ from this type of observation 
        arises in a variety of contexts, including nonmetric 
        multidimensional scaling, ``unfolding,'' and ranking problems, often 
        because it provides a powerful and flexible model of preference. 
        The main contribution of this paper is to show that 
        under a randomized model for $\p$ and $\q$, a suitable number of 
        binary paired comparisons yield a stable embedding of the space of 
        target vectors.
