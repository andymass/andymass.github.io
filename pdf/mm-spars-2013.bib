    abstract    = {In this paper we consider the related problems of
        ranking and of recovering a matrix of pairwise comparisons from binary
        observations.  We describe a naïve adaptation of the one-bit matrix
        completion framework, but then note that additional constraints that
        arise in the context of ranking allows us to replace nuclear norm
        minimization with a more direct approach.  This ultimately leads to a
        novel viewpoint on a classic approach to the ranking problem.Both
        theoretical and experimental results show that this simplified
        approach to recovering a pairwise comparison matrix performs
        significantly better than the naïve approach.
