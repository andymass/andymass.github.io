        Mass spectrometry is one of the primary methods for chemical analysis
        and serves as a fundamental tool in numerous scientific
        disciplines. In this paper we consider the design of 
        time-of-flight mass spectrometers, which produce a stream of 
        measurements which can be modeled by a convolution between the mass 
        spectrum of interest and a specified pulsing pattern. Our goal is to 
        reduce the total time necessary to analyze a sample to a given 
        precision (or equivalently, given a fixed amount of time, to obtain a 
        more precise estimate of the sample). We can do this by leveraging the
        structure that exists in typical mass spectra. In particular,
        since any given substance is usually composed of a relatively small
        number of distinct molecules, mass spectra tend to be relatively
        sparse. In this paper we perform an analysis of an idealized model 
        of a time-of-flight mass spectrometer which uses a randomized pulsing 
        pattern.  Such an architecture has the potential to enable a new 
        tradeoff between acquisition time and precision/dynamic range.  
        We show that under certain natural conditions on the randomized 
        scheme---namely, that the system does not pulse too often---this 
        construction will lead to a system which satisfies certain desirable 
        properties that are sufficient to ensure that sparse recovery is
        possible. In particular, we show that with high probability, the
        system will satisfy the conditions of a bipartite expander graph
        provided the pulsing rate is not too large. We then conclude with a
        range of simulations that support our theoretical analysis and
        demonstrate the practical viability of this approach.
