I received my Ph.D. from the [School of Electrical and Computer
Engineering][1] at the [Georgia Institute of Technology][2] advised by
[Mark Davenport][3].

My research applied theory in signal processing and machine learning to
develop techniques for adaptive signal acquisition which can cope with
measurement constraints. The goal of this work is to use structured data
models to enable higher quality inference and prediction with less labeled
data in diverse applications, e.g., imaging, targeted advertising, and
recommendation systems. 

My interests include: statistical signal processing, machine learning, active learning,
randomized algorithms, compressed sensing, experimental design,
recommendation systems, and collaborative filtering.

Before Georgia Tech, I attended the
[The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art][4]
where I received the Bachelor of Engineering degree.
