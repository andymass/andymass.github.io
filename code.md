## Constrained adaptive sensing

This software package contains code that  can be used to select an optimal
set  of  measurements for  sensing  a  sparse  vector in  the  constrained
setting. For  further  details,  see   the  paper  "[Constrained  adaptive
sensing][1],"   by  M. A. Davenport,   A. K. Massimino,  D. Needell,   and
T. Woolf.

The code can  be downloaded [here][2]; see the included  readme file for a
detailed description of the contents and for usage instructions.
